description: SMPL2Biomechanics is pipeline for estimating human biomechanical data (ground reaction force, joint torque) using the SMPL body model and AMASS motion datasets. The system employs inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics through the CusToM library to extract biomechanical parameters and biomechanical key points are mapped from the SKEL skeleton model. SMPL2Biomechanics enables comprehensive analysis and modeling of human motion dynamics at scale.
