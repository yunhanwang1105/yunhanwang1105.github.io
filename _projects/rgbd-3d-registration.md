description: This project presents a few-shot framework for RGBD 3D registration of articulated objects. It constructs a kinematic template using $\sim10$ RGBD images and DINOv2 descriptors. Registration to a new instance is achieved via optimal transport matching and a subsequent optimization routine involving TEASER++. The proof-of-concept on humans yields sensible registrations but highlights the need for better kinematic constraints and geometry-aware descriptors.
