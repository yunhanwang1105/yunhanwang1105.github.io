name: Probabilistic 3D Reconstruction from Single RGBD Image
photo: /assets/images/projects/Probabilistic_3D_Reconstruction.png
description: This projects builds a probabilistic ensemble of 3D reconstructions of an object from a single RGBD image. It uses geometric primitives from a template mesh to generate a dataset, fits a Gaussian Process (GP), and samples from its posterior. This successfully captures and represents the geometric uncertainty in occluded regions.
