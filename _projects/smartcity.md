description: SmartCity is a microservice-based Crowd Management Decision Support System (CMDSS) developed in collaboration with Scenwise. The system enhances urban crowd monitoring by integrating real-time shared mobility (MaaS) data and social media analytics. Using machine learning, it performs sentiment analysis, object detection, and crowd counting on social media posts to infer crowd behavior. The platform employs a React–Spring Boot–Python architecture with Mapbox visualization, enabling scalable, data-driven urban decision-making.
