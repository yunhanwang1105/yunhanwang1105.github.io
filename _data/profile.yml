    I am pursuing my Master's degree in Machine Learning at the <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/studium/studierende/lehre-studienorganisation/studiengaenge/machine-learning/" target="_blank">University of Tübingen</a>, Germany. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Honours & Cum Laude (highest distinction) from the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/" target="_blank">Delft University of Technology</a>, Netherlands.
  </p>
  <p>
    I desire to glimpse new ways of seeing machine learning, especially its ability to explain the underlying mechanism of the world, and its human-centric applications.
